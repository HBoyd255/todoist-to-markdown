# Todoist to Markdown

<!-- Harry Boyd - hboyd255@gmail.com - 06/05/2024 -->

This is a simple script that converts a Todoist CSV export to a markdown file.

I created this script because I wanted a quick way to provide my team with an
overview of the remaining tasks in a project. Previously, without inviting every
team member to the project, the only way to share this information was as
screenshots.

## Usage

1. Export your Todoist project as a CSV file.
2. Run the script with the path to the CSV file as an argument.
3. The script will output a markdown file with the same name as the CSV file.
